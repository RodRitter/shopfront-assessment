# DVT Storefront

## Setup

```
npm install
// or
yarn
```

## Start

```
npm start
// or
yarn start
```

## Tests

**Note**
I've created a single example test suite (Button component) to showcase how I would implement them on the frontend.

With a component library, I would add tests for every component with logic.

```
npm run test
// or
yarn test
```
